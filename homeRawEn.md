The Dromotherm project, financed by the Pack Ambition Recherche fund of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region over the period 2020 - 2025,
combines research on energy, buildings, roads and connected objects, proposing an operational articulation based on intelligent
energy networks. It aims to develop a lo-fi smart grid to meet the heating needs of buildings, using a "solar thermic" road, 
using only proven and controlled implementation techniques.

The Dromotherm project focuses on the issue of passive buildings and positive energy islands, powered by low-temperature 
heating networks.

## The fatal heat of the roads to power a building ?

The concept developed as part of the Dromotherm project aims to value the energy potential of roads in urban areas 
by recovering heat captured by pavements during summer periods, storing it in the ground at the base of buildings, 
and providing for their heating needs during winter periods.

This innovation will also help to reduce the intensity of urban heat islands during heat waves, and 
could also be used for road safety purposes by occasionally heating roads in the event of a risk of ice storm.
