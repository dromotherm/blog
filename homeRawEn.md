The Dromotherm project, financed by the Pack Ambition Recherche fund of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region over the period 2020 - 2025,
combines research on energy, buildings, roads and connected objects, proposing an operational articulation based on intelligent
energy networks. It aims to develop a lo-fi smart grid to meet the heating needs of buildings, using a "solar thermic" road, 
requiring only proven and controlled implementation techniques.

The Dromotherm project focuses on passive buildings and positive energy islands, powered by low-temperature 
heating networks.

## The fatal heat of the roads to power a building ?

The concept developed as part of the Dromotherm project aims to value the energy potential of roads in urban areas 
by recovering heat captured by pavements during summer periods, storing it in the ground at the base of buildings, 
and providing for their heating needs during winter periods.

This innovation will also help to reduce the intensity of urban heat islands during heat waves, and 
could also be used for road safety purposes by occasionally heating roads in winter, during severe cold periods.

The challenge is to design a new generation of smart grid connecting roads and buildings, using the principles of subsurface geothermal energy in urban areas. The latter, which consists in using the heat captured by the ground to meet the needs of the building, could thus be applied in cities, whereas it has so far been reserved for the single-family home.

Thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT), the system provides real-time information on production, the energy consumption and needs of the building or road. We are moving closer to the philosophy of distributed energy, popularized by Jeremy RIFKIN's "Third Industrial Revolution".
